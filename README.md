# Directional T^2 Hypothesis testing

Since I could not find any existing `R` code to implement directional hotelling T^2 (a T^2 with a directional alternative, kind of like a two sample t-test with directional alternative), I implemented it myself.

## Recreating clinical trials result in section 6
Recreating the examples in "Directional multivariate tests rejecting null and negative effects in all variables" by Glimm (2009)
see `example.pdf` for details on paper example.

## Upload R function. 
see `directionalt2.R` for `R` code implementation of Follmann (1996) and Glimm (2009)
