# Section 6 example

## Follmann's method

Recreating author example. Numbers are a little different than mine, but they're close. (Edit: Confirmed with Glimm, these are correct)

  * F-stat off due to rounding
  * p-value is supposed to be halved since they double their significance level (e.g. if $\alpha = 0.05$, they would look for $2\alpha$, that's why it's under the subscript.)

```{R}
mean_diff <- matrix(c(0.35, - 2.4, -19.4), nrow = 1)
new <- matrix(c(0.38, 17, 43, 17, 2763, 3257, 43, 3257, 12042), nrow = 3)
old <- matrix( c(.17, 8.4, 20, 8.4, 2752, 2043, 20, 2043, 7572), nrow = 3) 

my_pool_cov <- (31*new + 31*old)/(62)
author_pool_cov <- matrix(c(0.27, 12.7, 32, 12.7, 2758, 2758, 32, 2650, 9807),nrow = 3)

c <- (32 + 32 - 3 - 1)/(3 * (32 + 32 -1)) * (32*32)/(32+32)
my_stat <-  c * mean_diff %*% solve(my_pool_cov) %*% t(mean_diff)
author_stat <-c * mean_diff %*% solve(author_pool_cov) %*% t(mean_diff)

c(my_stat, author_stat)

pf(c(my_stat, author_stat), 3, 60, lower.tail = F)
```

Authors F-stat is 5.37 and corresponding p-value of 0.0024, which is the result from :

```{R}
pf(5.37, 3, 60, lower.tail = F)
```
But this p-value should be divide by 2 since the significance level is doubled (Confirmed with Author)


## Glimm's Method 

```{r}
min_mu_obj <- function(mu, G, mean_diff){
x_bar <- matrix(mu, nrow = 1)  - mean_diff 
(32 + 32 - 3 - 1)/(3 * (32 + 32 -1)) * (32*32)/(32+32) * x_bar %*% solve(G) %*% t(x_bar)
}

ex_val <- optim(par = rep(0,3),
                fn = min_mu_obj,
                upper = rep(0,3),
                method = "L-BFGS-B",
                mean_diff = mean_diff,
                G = my_pool_cov)

#output of the optimization function (minimized when mu = par)
ex_val

#p-value
pf(ex_val$value, df1 = 3,df2 =  32+32-3-1, lower.tail = F)
```

These results basically match, who found optimal value of (0, -18.4, -59.5) and a F-statistic of 2.27, with corresponding p-value of 0.0447. Here the p-value is halved.
